# Ahoy!

I'm a software engineer, more or less, I just like telling magic rocks what to do. My relationship with programming languages I could define as *polyamory*, although there are a few that I like the most:

- **Java** - for being versatile, field-tested, and simply working, however, Kotlin is trying to replace it.
- **Python** - for everything, it's my main choice when prototyping, scripting, or when I need to code something fast.
- **C** - for simple and complete syntax, and for being able to run everywhere where there's a compiler for the platform, which simply means everywhere.
- **C++** - tough relationship.

Other languages I've tried, I know, but don't actively use: ES6, Haskell, x64 Assembler, Swift, Brainfuck, Lua, PHP, and I've surely forgotten about something.

## My repos worth looking at

Although every repo is worth seeing, here are the few that I would like to underline.

### ⭐️ [Hotkey Detective](https://github.com/ITachiLab/hotkey-detective)

This is a small Windows application that lets you find out what other application holds a global hotkey, preventing you from using that specific key combination in other places.

**Repo's curiosities:**

- Windows API
- Windows tricks
- Integrating Windows API and C++

### ⭐️ [Low-delay PL011 driver](https://github.com/ITachiLab/pl011-no-fifo)

My modification of the mainline PL011 (UART) driver for Raspberry Pi. The modification turns off FIFO queueing, effectively speeding up communications which mostly consist of short and single-byte bursts. This is perfect for integration with eBUS (I'm using it for my heating circuit controller).

**Repo's curiosities:**

- Disabling unwanted, built-in drivers

## Handcrafted code

Not a single line in my repo (and outside of the repo) was written by AI. I prefer to do my own research, and build the code with full consciousness of what I'm doing, even if it takes longer. This is how we learn, how we develop creativity, and explore new ways of solving problems.
